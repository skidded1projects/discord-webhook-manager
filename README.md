A friendly Discord webhook utility tool with a crabby twist!

## Why Mystic Hooks?

I made this tool because I needed something simple and reliable to manage Discord webhooks â€” spamming, renaming, deleting, and checking them â€” without extra hassle.

The crab theme is just for fun. This is straightforward code, built to work well and be easy to use.
